MIDI based arduino Octapad


This is an Arduino Based octapad in which all the analog inputs are read by the arduiono nano board. this board have 8 analog pins each connected to individual peizo electric sensor, whcih take the input from user in the form of vibrations and further this signal is converted to a digital signal and communicated throu a software called LOOP MIDI and HAIRLESS MIDI Driver. then the final processing is done in a DIGITAL AUdio Workstation called FL studio. then according to the vibrtations sensed the final audio output is then generated by FL Studio and we get the audio on a large speaker.

All the parts are made of wood by hand.
Each and every Cutting is selfdone.
For reference SOme images during the process were taken and are attached along with the repository.
